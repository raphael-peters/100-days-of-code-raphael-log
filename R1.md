## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2019

### Day 1: July 21st 2019 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Spent time building the skeleton of the Impulse Android App I plan to make.

**Thoughts:** Really trying to get the hang of writing useful psuedocode that will easily help me make the real codebase. I will build this skeleton as a command line app first of all, and then start expanding my knowledge on how to develop android apps.

**New things learned** I was searching for a way to make the Java equivalent of Python 'dictionaries'. Turns out there is something called Map built into Java, with it's own inner workings such as HashMap, Entry, HashTable etc. These allow you to set key-value pairs within an object. You can also access them individually by calling the Key which can return the value, as well as the ability to print all sets within the object. Will keep learning more about this as I feel it will be a powerful tool when dealing with sets of data.

**Link to work:** Just psuedocode today so nothing to link/push to git as of yet.
