## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2019

### Day 1: July 21st 2019 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Spent time building the skeleton of the Impulse Android App I plan to make.

**Thoughts:** Really trying to get the hang of writing useful psuedocode that will easily help me make the real codebase. I will build this skeleton as a command line app first of all, and then start expanding my knowledge on how to develop android apps.

**New things learned** I was searching for a way to make the Java equivalent of Python 'dictionaries'. Turns out there is something called Map built into Java, with it's own inner workings such as HashMap, Entry, HashTable etc. These allow you to set key-value pairs within an object. You can also access them individually by calling the Key which can return the value, as well as the ability to print all sets within the object. Will keep learning more about this as I feel it will be a powerful tool when dealing with sets of data.

**Link to work:** Just psuedocode today so nothing to link/push to git as of yet.


### Day 2: July 22nd 2019 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Spent time reading up on Map.Entry in the Java Docs. Then proceeded to work on some nested For Loops in Headfirst Java.

**Thoughts:** Was tough to get motivated today. Had a very long day at work and came home not feeling like getting any coding in. I am commited to this though so pushed through and tried to learn more about things I wil be using in my application. Also took some time to progress in a textbook I wish to finish before the end of summer.

**New things learned** Learned about the methods that I can use with Map.Entry. It has methods built in that allow you to access the key/value pairs individually, and also set the value. It also has a method that allows you to return the 'hashcode'. I tried reading more on this but could not get a simple explanation about what the hashcode actually is, and what it is useful for. Will research this more tomorrow.

**Link to work:** Did my reading at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.Entry.html


### Day 3: July 23rd 2019 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Spent time going over ArrayLists in Headfirst Java.

**Thoughts:** Was a great day coding wise. Didn't have work that day so could dedicate the full day to coding. Was easy to crush through the textbook and understand what I was consuming. It was not my first exposure to ArrayLists but I definitely grasped more than I initially did when learning through Udemy. Found myself questioning the books solution which I think is good. Everyone will come up with different answers to questions, and I think me finding their way of doing things interesting, yet wanting to challenge it, is a healthy mindset to have going forward.

**New things learned** Got a better grasp of the wrapper/value passed into the ArrayList<>.

**Link to work:** No link to work but used Headfirst Java.


### Day 4: July 24th 2019 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning on ArrayLists in Headfirst Java.

**Thoughts:** Trying not to get demotivated but definitely find it harder to work on code/study after a day at work. I feel more tired as I am reading or trying to understand concepts. That was my main struggle today and found I could not get as many hours in as I would have liked. Continued on ArrayLists and feel I understood what I read, however, there was an advanced bit of code that went over my head. Will have to review tomorrow.

**New things learned** Got a better grasp of placing object(references) into ArrayList index slots.

**Link to work:** No link to work but used Headfirst Java.


### Day 5: July 25th 2019 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Continued with ArrayLists and came up with my own definitions of certain terms used with ArrayLists.

**Thoughts:** Hopefully the last lethargic day in the books as it was the final day I had to work before summer vaction. I think from now I can have coding as my sole focus. I know once I start my career as a developer it will be all day every day but having it as my only thing to focus on, instead of mixing it with another career will be helpful. I learned some interesting things about the Java Library (API) and the various packages that are included in Java.

**New things learned** WHY import is so important/useful as I have now seen how much typing will need to be done for every line of code that uses something for the library, if said library is not imported.

**Link to work:** No link to work but used Headfirst Java.


### Day 6: July 26th 2019 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Went over inheritance in OOP and did an exercise on Hackerrank.

**Thoughts:** Learned about the IS-A relationship that inherited subclasses have from their parent superclasses. Got to keep in mind the difference between the IS-A and HAS-A relationship in OOP. Really important that it makes sense when coding with these in mind. 

**New things learned** Learned a new way to draw Inheritance Class diagrams. Definitely will be useful to visualize/plan out classes that will use inheritance. Also learned about printf through Hackerrank. Have never been exposed to it before but found it quite interesting once I got to grips to it. I can see why it can be easier to use than a regular print statement for certain things, although I am not sure how often I will use it in my own codebases.
