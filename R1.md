## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2019

### Day 1: July 21st 2019 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Spent time building the skeleton of the Impulse Android App I plan to make.

**Thoughts:** Really trying to get the hang of writing useful psuedocode that will easily help me make the real codebase. I will build this skeleton as a command line app first of all, and then start expanding my knowledge on how to develop android apps.

**New things learned** I was searching for a way to make the Java equivalent of Python 'dictionaries'. Turns out there is something called Map built into Java, with it's own inner workings such as HashMap, Entry, HashTable etc. These allow you to set key-value pairs within an object. You can also access them individually by calling the Key which can return the value, as well as the ability to print all sets within the object. Will keep learning more about this as I feel it will be a powerful tool when dealing with sets of data.

**Link to work:** Just psuedocode today so nothing to link/push to git as of yet.


### Day 2: July 22nd 2019 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Spent time reading up on Map.Entry in the Java Docs. Then proceeded to work on some nested For Loops in Headfirst Java.

**Thoughts:** Was tough to get motivated today. Had a very long day at work and came home not feeling like getting any coding in. I am commited to this though so pushed through and tried to learn more about things I wil be using in my application. Also took some time to progress in a textbook I wish to finish before the end of summer.

**New things learned** Learned about the methods that I can use with Map.Entry. It has methods built in that allow you to access the key/value pairs individually, and also set the value. It also has a method that allows you to return the 'hashcode'. I tried reading more on this but could not get a simple explanation about what the hashcode actually is, and what it is useful for. Will research this more tomorrow.

**Link to work:** Did my reading at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.Entry.html
